# LDM3D

LDM3D was proposed in [LDM3D: Latent Diffusion Model for 3D](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10853) by Gabriela Ben Melech Stan, Diana Wofk, Scottie Fox, Alex Redden, Will Saxton, Jean Yu, Estelle Aflalo, Shao-Yen Tseng, Fabio Nonato, Matthias Muller, Vasudev Lal
The abstract of the paper is the following:

*This research paper proposes a Latent Diffusion Model for 3D (LDM3D) that generates both image and depth map data from a given text prompt, allowing users to generate RGBD images from text prompts. The LDM3D model is fine-tuned on a dataset of tuples containing an RGB image, depth map and caption, and validated through extensive experiments. We also develop an application called DepthFusion, which uses the generated RGB images and depth maps to create immersive and interactive 360-degree-view experiences using TouchDesigner. This technology has the potential to transform a wide range of industries, from entertainment and gaming to architecture and design. Overall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of generative AI and computer vision, and showcases the potential of LDM3D and DepthFusion to revolutionize content creation and digital experiences.

## Tips

- LDM3D diffusion is conceptually exactly the same as [Stable Diffusion](./stable_diffusion/overview).

- *Run LDM3D*

LDM3D can be tested very easily with the [`StableDiffusionLDM3DPipeline`]

- *How to load and use different schedulers.*

The LDM3D diffusion pipeline uses [`DDIMScheduler`] scheduler by default.
To use a different scheduler, you can either change it via the [`ConfigMixin.from_config`] method or pass the `scheduler` argument to the `from_pretrained` method of the pipeline. For example, to use the [`EulerDiscreteScheduler`], you can do the following:

```python
>>> from diffusers import StableDiffusionLDM3DPipeline

>>> pipeline = StableDiffusionLDM3DPipeline.from_pretrained("Intel/ldm3d")
prompt ="A picture of some lemons on a table"
output = pipe_ldm3d(prompt)
rgb_image, depth_image = output.rgb, output.depth
```
